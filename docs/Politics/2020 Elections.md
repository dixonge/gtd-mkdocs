Title: 2020 Elections
---
I am *just starting* to research this. We all know the narratives. Democrats say it was all a completely normal and fair election. Republicans claim it was rigged and stolen. At this point I'm leaning toward the 'rigged' concept, which could be as simple as jerrymandered redistricting or as nefarious as fraudulent ballots. Not sure.

So far all I have is some diagrams I have been drawing to try and figure things out. Those are below. More to come soon, I hope.
